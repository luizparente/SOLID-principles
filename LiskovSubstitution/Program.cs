			This example is purely illustrative, and is not a design pattern recommendation.

			It uses static classes to encapsulate related functionality. While functional, 
			this is not a design pattern that can be applied effectively in all cases. 
			
			The recommended approach is always with interfaces and Dependency Injection.
